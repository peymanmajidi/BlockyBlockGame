# BlockyBlockGame
Hello every one, I hope you doing good
Because I want to be more familiar with Python, I decided to make a game 
and the result is Blocky block.
I found out Python is cool and easy :)
In this game you can draw on screen by mouse and move the 'blocky' via keyboard'a [arrow keys] all over the screen.

Please download the source code and make fantastic forks üç¥
